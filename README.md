# qr-code-component

The HTML code you provided is a basic structure for a web page that seems to showcase a QR code component. Here's a breakdown of what's included in this HTML:

1. **Metadata**: 
   - Character set (`<meta charset="UTF-8" />`): Defines the character encoding for the document.
   - Viewport (`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />`): Ensures that the website is displayed correctly on various devices.
   
2. **Stylesheets**: 
   - A custom stylesheet (`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />`) is linked for styling purposes.
   - A favicon (`<link rel="icon" ... />`) is included for the website's tab.
   - Google Fonts (`<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">`) are imported to use the "Outfit" font in the web page.

3. **Body Content**: 
   - A main container (`<div class="main-container">`) wraps the content of the page.
   - Inside the container, there are two main blocks:
     - **QR Code Block**: This block contains an image (`<img src="images\image-qr-code.png" class="qr-code" />`) displaying a QR code.
     - **Text Block**: This block contains a heading (`<h1>`) and a paragraph (`<p>`). The text encourages users to scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and improve their front-end skills.
   
4. **Attribution**: 
   - At the bottom of the page, there's an attribution section that gives credit to Frontend Mentor for the challenge and allows for adding your name as the coder.

Overall, this HTML structure provides a simple and clean layout to showcase a QR code and some accompanying text. The design and additional styling will be determined by the linked CSS (`style.css`) and any additional styles you might add.
